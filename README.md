# My website

My professional website created with React + TypeScript + Vite.

## Available scripts

### Install project dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Run the app in the development mode

```sh
npm start
```

### Deploy app to GitHub Pages

```sh
npm run deploy
```

### Update packages

```sh
npx npm-check-updates
```

## Env-files

Required public keys for EmailJS and reCAPTCHA are imported from .env-files. Usually .env-files are not committed to version control, but I made an exception here as I don't want to check the public keys again from admin consoles.
